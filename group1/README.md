# Requirements
## Why requirements
When codes have some requirements (like particular libraries, or so on), you can find them in the related txt file.
## How to install them
The suggestion is to create a virtual environment if you have other running projects, by following the [venv guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), or usying a wrapper (like [this one](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=python-virtualenvwrapper)).

Once you are ready, you can install the requirements by typing:

```
pip install -r <requirements_file_name>.txt
```
